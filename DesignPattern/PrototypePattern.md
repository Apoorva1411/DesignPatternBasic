<h1>Prototype Pattern </h1>	

â€‹						This pattern is used to clone the objects rather than creating new objects. Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client. The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, something that may include costly operations. The existing object acts as a prototype and contains the state of the object. The newly copied object may change same properties only if required. 

Please find UML for same :
