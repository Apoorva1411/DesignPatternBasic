<h1>Facade Pattern </h1>	

â€‹						This pattern is used to hide the complexity of method to client. Complexity of method is hiding and client gets interface to access the functionality. Developers often use the facade design pattern when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has many interdependent classes or because its source code is unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client.
