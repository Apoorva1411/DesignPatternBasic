<h1>Builder Pattern</h1>

â€‹			This pattern is used when we have requirement to build complex object . The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. For Example we can take construction of house , which is complex procedure. We can have ***Director*** class i.e Contractor in this example who will guide the ***builder*** class  i.e Housebuilder in this case to build the house. The implementation or representation would be defined in another class.
