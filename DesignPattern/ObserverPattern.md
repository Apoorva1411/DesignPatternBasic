<h1>Obsever Pattern </h1>	

â€‹						The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. This pattern can be used when one object get affected with changes in other object. In such case **Observable** object notifies other ***observers*** regarding changes.
